# Packet-Tracer-Wireless-Router-Example

## Contextualization
In this example, we have a wireless router that is providing IPs via DHCP and connecting the devices. PC0 is not connected to the network, so try connecting by using the password "123456789" in the "PC Wireless" tab under "Desktop" on PC0, and the router will appear under "connect"

## Devices:
- 1 - Straight-Through Cable
- 1 - WRT300N
